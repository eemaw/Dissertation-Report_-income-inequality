Analysed income inequality of 38 OECD countries.The thesis explores over four decades of income share data to assess income inequality across 38 OECD countries, utilizing analytical tools such as the Lorenz Curve, Gini Coefficient, and Hoover Index within R Studio. The analysis reveals that Colombia experienced the highest levels of inequality until 1997, after which Mexico took the lead from 2003 onward. Chile also maintained consistently high inequality. In contrast, countries like Denmark, Sweden, and Norway demonstrated the lowest inequality levels. By 2022, 24 countries were positioned below the OECD’s average Gini index of 0.36, while 14 countries—including all American OECD members—ranked above it, with lower inequality generally concentrated in Western, Central, and Northern Europe. In addition, statistical techniques such as linear regression were applied to examine the relationship between income inequality and the degree of income redistribution required for equality, as well as to investigate the correlation between unemployment rates and income inequality.
